1340780470	NEW ORLEANS – DEVITT COMPANY LOCKDOWN
1931549038	A smell of seaweed surrounds the bloated corpse. As you search his pockets, you find a small figurine. A disturbing display of a foreign creatue, tentacles surrounding its gaping mouth. 
884720503	Something unexplainable has happened in New Orleans tonight. Three murders were commited, all exactly when the clock struck 6.
9708345	The first victim: A captain who wanted to escape his fate. His rusty vessel the only thing that kept him afloat. Beneath him, the blackness of the river. And inside him an even darker blackness. 
1450293716	It is done. The butcher lies dead before you, the eldritch flame inside him extinguished. His soul is beyond redemption, but New Orleans has weathered the storm... for now. Good work.
526570151	Investigate Crime Scenes

577617173	The Depths
382025701	A captain who wanted to escape his fate. His rusty vessel the only thing that kept him afloat. Beneath him, the blackness of the river. And inside him an even darker blackness. 
601936825	The Loner
254541811	A lonely person met a lonely death. Surrounded by his only friends, cackling, picking litter from the floor, picking blood from his veins, picking meat from his innards.
1184941873	Amongst Pigs
963001693	An honorable man, slaughtered and left amongst the filthiest. An unjust end, for he gave hope and comfort to those who needed it the most.
1209259200	The Metal Badge
825897588	A small metal badge found on the body. It reads "Florence Smolker's Oriental Spices".
1740598686	The Body
1325527419	There is something wrong with that persons corpse. A little shine, only visible if seen in the furtherst corner of the eye. It draws you to it. Hard to resist.
1163939158	The Chickens
1200022366	The chickens are picking away at the rotting body in the corner. You get the feeling that something is calling to you. From... inside the chickens. It's voice growing more intense by the second. Until it is an unbearable scream inside of your head.
1879106691	The sweet stench of decay invades your nostrils. As you examine the pig's body you see something in the corner of your eye. A glittering object hidden in the pockets of the human corpse next to it. 
707546696	As you pick up the body, a tiny metal badge drops to the floor. It reads "Florence Smolker's Oriental Spices".
115228868	The sweet stench of decay invades your nostrils. You examine the pig's body but find nothing. The badge in your pocket seems to be pulsating, like it wants to tell you "Ignore those filthy bodies. FIND. THE. LOCK."
1262534177	As you go through the corpse's pockets, the cackle of the chickens seems to get louder and louder. You see them occasionally picking into the corpse's open wound, devouring it's flesh. 
2036902556	As you cut open the chicken, you find a small coin. It is covered in blood and guts, but seems to be glowing like a radiant miniature sun. You can almost feel it buzzing in your hand. 
772586931	As you enter the store, the revitalizing smell of different spices quickly gets to your head. You instantly know where to look. You open a small cupboard in the darkest corner of the room.
1232845740	As you put the third artifact into your pocket, a creeping chill crawls over your spine. Your sight starts to get blurry as you fight to keep your balance. Something in New Orleans has... changed. 
1103300527	The next day – Bayous of New Orleans, Louisiana
2086026573	You did it!
114163874	DEVITT GOLDMINE – SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO

1872830447	Later that day – Eagle Falls Bridge, Colorado
665079477	Nicely done. All ready and safe for transport. I knew I could count on your discretion.
1462795072	Running your fingers over the figurine's smooth, pitchblack surface, you feel like you are slowly starting to slip...  You  quickly hide it in one of your pockets.
2042798963	You put the badge in your pocket. Shortly after, it starts pulsating, like it wants to tell you "Ignore those filthy bodies. FIND. THE. LOCK."
138387610	You realize that something inside one of the chickens is calling to you. An uncanny whisper that grows inside your head. "Let me out."
653215157	As you wipe the blood off of it, the buzzing stops. It's just a dull, rusty coin now. You put it into your pocket.
412945230	Inside you find a tiny horn with neatly executed carvings on it. You cannot decipher their meaning. Quickly, you put the horn into your pocket.
1466539405	You can feel the presence of the killer. It is time to avenge the dead or get torn to pieces yourself.
2076581508	The second victim: A lonely person, meeting a lonely death. Surrounded by his only friends, cackling, picking litter from the floor, picking blood from his veins, picking meat from his innards.
1520042128	The third victim: An honorable man, slaughtered and left among the filth. An unjust end, for he gave hope and comfort to those who needed it most.

1809509597	Do you think you're ready?
941798258	Let's take a trip down memory lane. Ask ourselves "what if?". One last visit to Devil's Canyon. One more shot at redemption.
1265043144	This time, two mismatched figures approach. One is the kid, knives in hand. The other is the trapper, eyes watchful.
1996320184	They've come here for the same reason they all come. The man they call Frank. He's waiting at the chapel. Not much farther to go.
2143700932	And just like that, it's over. The man they call Frank lies dead in the sand. The kid stands triumphant, his father avenged.
1393836394	McCoy

209249049	It appears Miss O'Hara has been trapped at the altar again. The ceremony is well on its way. Once the priest arrives, her fate is sealed.
2023952286	There goes the servant to let the priest in.
1832990057	Take her out before she reaches the gate, or you will lose before you can even start.
198341473	Once she is out of the picture, you will have time for a little more... mischief.

69930805	You pick up the piece of paper. It's not a letter, but a small drawing. A coin, an uncanny figurine and a small horn. They form a triangle. In it's center, a haunting depicition of a demonic figure. It's eyes seem to pierce right into your soul.
203047558	Suddenly, you hear the crashing waves of the harbor again. You don't know how long you were staring at the drawing. Disgusted, you tear it apart and throw away the pieces. The only thing left is a sickening feeling deep in your stomach. Whatever is going on here, you have to put an end to it.
1137129970	Maybe after this he will finally show us some gratitude.

1656235817	That's one for the mantlepiece.

1937238544	Let's test how free of sin this priest really is.
987448738	Anyway, your targets today will be three simple men. Siblings, in fact. One might even say they look exactly alike.
638189593	My clients want you to bring them to the bank and put them inside the coffins. The catch is, you'll have to find them first.
1719544610	Take a good look at this man. His clothes, his hair, his skin. He looks exactly like your targets. Use this to find your targets.
851475634	My clients are watching. Give them a show.
20331815	Deliver judgement from above. My clients are watching.
468356500	They push on through. Goings are hard. Franks men are many, and there's only two of them.
1500960987	The trapper looks at the kid, the knives in his hands. He has seen the kid throw those knifes a thousand times. The kid doesn't miss anymore.
660965238	The trapper keeps his weapon ready. He's watched the kid get crushed once. He won't let it happen again.
286197728	They've made it halfway to the chapel. Still a ways to go. How many has the kid killed already? He tries not to think about it.
2014509736	The kid acts like nothing's up, but his knees are weak. What if he's not ready this time? He pushes on regardless.
1647658802	The kid looks down at his hands. They have been washed clean with blood. At least his heart is at peace, or so he hopes.
1714075236	Maybe it would have been better that way. But reality has a habit of taking its time. We both know that's not how the story goes. A childs dream will always remain a fantasy.
329926232	This was a rare treat. Thank you for indulging me. I think this concludes our business, for the time being.

Just some harmless fun. I think you've earned it."/n/nWhen you ask the cook who brought this letter, he just gives you a grumpy laugh before leaving you to your beans.
535138508	The Baron has sent you back to DeVitt's gold mine for his latest challenge. A special device has been prepared for you, a minecart that can turn into a Gatling gun. Perplexing surely, but that has never stopped the Baron. He tasked you to clear the map of enemies. Should be fun, yes?
171688385	For a Few Bullets More
658505006	You walk through a graveyard in the middle of nowhere. Smoke from your cigarette is carried away by the prairie wind. One of the graves lies open, a letter waiting for you in the coffin./n/n"Fancy meeting you here, friend. Taking some time to reminisce? How about a little challenge while you're at it. Let's find out what kind of person you are."/n/nYou look up from the writing and read the name on the gravestone. Unsurprisingly, it is your own. You smile, put out your cigarette on the tombstone and throw the butt into the open coffin.
1844062476	In this world, there's only two kinds of people my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. Let's see what kind you belong to. Kill everyone on the map.

1778221076	Doc McCoy is sitting in a private room at the local saloon. He has taken apart his Buntline, inspecting and cleaning every piece, a grim smile of satisfaction on his face./n/nMcCoy reaches down into his bag to retrieve an oil cloth. His hands brush against something that should not be there. A letter. He slowly picks it up, expects it from each side, then opens it with a scalpel./n/n"A new contract has come in. Details are enclosed within the envelope. My clients expect nothing but quality, Mr. McCoy. Impress them, and I will consider part of your debts repaid."/n/nMcCoy reads the letter carefully, then burns it at a nearby candle. As it burns, he reassembles his gun with quick, well-practiced movements. He is out the door before the ashes have cooled. 
326727781	You have returned to Casa DeVitt, where Doc McCoy must complete a personal contract for the Baron. Stationed on the roof of the mansion, he must eliminate a number of targets with his Buntline without triggering the alarm. Kate and Hector are there to assist him on the ground.

603403823	A red coach halts next to you. The door swings open silently. Thick lamplight and cushioned seats await you inside. As you climb in, you are overcome with a profound sense of déjà vu./n/nThe Baron greets you with a pleasant smile. His clothes are expensive as usual, the colors outrageously bright against the darkness of his skin. His teeth are ivory. His eyes twinkling with... something entirely different./n/n"You have proven yourself a man of many talents, my friend. My clients are very pleased. In fact, you might have become their new favorite. But that is not why I'm here today."/n/n"Today, we will just talk. Call it... indulging my curiosity." He looks at you with those twinkling eyes, and you feel yourself slipping. He smiles. "Shall we begin?"
